# XMLResults
functions to represent all data fetched from db in XML form, I did create it first to connect ORACLE DB, then I rewrite it for MySQL. It receives a parameter which is executed SQL statement.

Its naming XML Tags according to field names (associative arrays keys), so if you need to change tag names, then use SQL Aliases.
